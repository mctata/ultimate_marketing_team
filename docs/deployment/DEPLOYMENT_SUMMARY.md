# Deployment Summary

This document summarizes the deployment options available for the Ultimate Marketing Team application.

## Deployment Environments

### Staging Environment

The staging environment is available at `https://staging.tangible-studios.com` and is hosted on a shared hosting provider.

**Deployment Commands:**
```bash
# Standard deployment
./scripts/deployment/staging/deploy.sh

# Quick deployment with existing archive
./scripts/deployment/staging/quick_deploy.sh <archive_name>

# Check service status
./scripts/deployment/staging/check_services.sh
```

For detailed instructions, see [Simplified Staging Deploy](SIMPLIFIED_STAGING_DEPLOY.md).

### EC2 Environment

The EC2 deployment is available at `https://staging.tangible-studios.com` (same domain, different server) and is hosted on AWS EC2.

**Deployment Commands:**
```bash
# Deploy to EC2
SSH_KEY=ultimate-marketing-staging.pem ./scripts/deployment/ec2/deploy.sh

# Check service status
SSH_KEY=ultimate-marketing-staging.pem ./scripts/deployment/ec2/check_services.sh

# Fix services if needed
SSH_KEY=ultimate-marketing-staging.pem ./scripts/deployment/ec2/fix_services.sh
```

For detailed instructions, see [EC2 Deployment Guide](EC2_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).

## Deployment Scripts Organization

All deployment scripts are organized in the `scripts/deployment/` directory:

```
deployment/
├── ec2/                # EC2-specific deployment scripts
│   ├── check_services.sh
│   ├── deploy.sh
│   └── fix_services.sh
├── shared/             # Shared utilities used by all deployment scripts
│   ├── ssl_setup.sh
│   └── utils.sh
├── staging/            # Staging-specific deployment scripts
│   ├── check_services.sh
│   ├── deploy.sh
│   └── quick_deploy.sh
└── archives/           # Deployment archives generated by the scripts
```

## Deployment Process

The general deployment process is as follows:

1. **Create Archive**: Package the application code into a deployment archive
2. **Transfer**: Upload the archive to the target server
3. **Extract**: Extract the archive on the server
4. **Configure**: Apply environment-specific configurations
5. **Start Services**: Start Docker containers and services
6. **Verify**: Verify that all services are running correctly

## Continuous Integration/Deployment

Automated deployments can be set up using GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD tools.

Sample workflow:
1. Push changes to the `staging` branch
2. Automated tests run
3. On test success, deploy to staging environment
4. Push changes to the `main` branch
5. Automated tests run
6. On test success, deploy to production environment

## Rollback Procedure

If a deployment fails or introduces issues:

1. Identify the issue using the check_services.sh script
2. Use quick_deploy.sh with a previous known-good archive
3. If that doesn't work, use fix_services.sh to rebuild and restart services
