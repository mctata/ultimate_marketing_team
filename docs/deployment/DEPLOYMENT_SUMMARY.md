# Deployment Summary

This document provides a summary of the deployment options for the Ultimate Marketing Team platform.

## EC2 Deployment (Recommended)

The Ultimate Marketing Team application can now be deployed to an Amazon EC2 instance at staging.tangible-studios.com.

### Deployment Process

1. Build and package the application:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy/ec2_deploy.sh
   ```

2. The script handles:
   - Building the frontend
   - Creating a deployment package
   - Uploading to the EC2 instance
   - Installing Docker if needed
   - Setting up all containers with docker-compose

### SSL Setup

For secure HTTPS access, set up SSL certificates:

1. For development: Generate self-signed certificates
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deployment/simple_ssl_setup.sh staging.tangible-studios.com
   ```

2. For production: Use Let's Encrypt certificates after deploying
   (See EC2_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions)

### Access the Application

After deployment, the application will be available at:
- https://staging.tangible-studios.com

## Legacy Shared Hosting Deployment

For legacy purposes, the original shared hosting deployment is still supported:

```bash
./scripts/deploy/deploy_staging.sh
```

Or for a simplified deployment:

```bash
./scripts/deploy/simplified_staging_deploy.sh
```
