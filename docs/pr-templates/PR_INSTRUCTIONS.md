## Pull Request Overview

This pull request implements a centralized logging system throughout the codebase, focusing on standardizing log formats, improving security by masking sensitive information, enhancing error handling, and providing consistent patterns for logging different operations.

The implementation follows the best practices for logging in Python applications:
- Structured logging with consistent format
- Security-conscious handling of sensitive data
- Detailed context for operations and errors
- Standardized error handling with appropriate log levels

All updated scripts have been tested to ensure functionality remains unchanged while improving the logging capabilities.

After the PR is merged:

1. Document the logging system in the project wiki
2. Consider implementing log rotation (already noted in the TODO list)
3. Add monitoring for log files to detect issues
4. Create guidelines for logging best practices for future development
