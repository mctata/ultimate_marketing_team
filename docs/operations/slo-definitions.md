# Service Level Objectives (SLO) and Service Level Agreements (SLA)

This document defines the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for the Ultimate Marketing Team platform. These metrics serve as our internal and external commitments to service reliability and performance.

## Key Definitions

- **Service Level Indicator (SLI)**: A quantitative measure of service reliability, such as availability or latency.
- **Service Level Objective (SLO)**: A target value or range for an SLI, representing our internal reliability goal.
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: A formal commitment to customers about service reliability, usually with consequences if not met.
- **Error Budget**: The allowed amount of unreliability derived from our SLOs (e.g., 99.9% availability allows for 43.8 minutes of downtime per month).

## Core SLOs

### API Availability

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Reporting Window |
|--------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **SLI** | Percentage of successful API requests (non-5xx responses) | Prometheus metrics: `sum(rate(http_requests_total{status!~"5.."}[1h])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total[1h]))` | 30-day rolling window |
| **SLO** | 99.95% | Grafana dashboard: "API Success Rate" | Monthly |
| **Error Budget** | 21.9 minutes per month | Alert when 75% consumed | Monthly reset |

### API Latency

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Reporting Window |
|--------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **SLI** | Percentage of API requests completed within threshold | Prometheus metrics: `sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"}[1h])) / sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count[1h]))` | 30-day rolling window |
| **SLO** | 95% of requests complete in < 500ms | Grafana dashboard: "API Response Time (p95)" | Monthly |
| **Error Budget** | 5% of requests can exceed 500ms | Alert when 75% consumed | Monthly reset |

### Content Generation Success Rate

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Reporting Window |
|--------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **SLI** | Percentage of successful content generation requests | Prometheus metrics: `sum(rate(content_creation_total{status="success"}[1d])) / sum(rate(content_creation_total[1d]))` | 30-day rolling window |
| **SLO** | 98% | Grafana dashboard: "Content Generation Success Rate" | Monthly |
| **Error Budget** | 2% of generation requests can fail | Alert when 75% consumed | Monthly reset |

### AI API Latency

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Reporting Window |
|--------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **SLI** | Percentage of AI API requests completed within threshold | Prometheus metrics: `sum(rate(ai_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="5.0"}[1h])) / sum(rate(ai_request_duration_seconds_count[1h]))` | 30-day rolling window |
| **SLO** | 90% of requests complete in < 5 seconds | Grafana dashboard: "AI API Response Time" | Monthly |
| **Error Budget** | 10% of requests can exceed 5 seconds | Alert when 75% consumed | Monthly reset |

### Database Query Latency

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Reporting Window |
|--------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **SLI** | Percentage of database queries completed within threshold | Prometheus metrics: `sum(rate(db_query_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.1"}[1h])) / sum(rate(db_query_duration_seconds_count[1h]))` | 30-day rolling window |
| **SLO** | 99% of queries complete in < 100ms | Grafana dashboard: "Database Query Latency" | Monthly |
| **Error Budget** | 1% of queries can exceed 100ms | Alert when 75% consumed | Monthly reset |

## Customer-Facing SLAs

The following SLAs represent our commitments to customers with corresponding service credits if breached:

### Platform Availability SLA

| Level | Availability | Downtime Allowed | Service Credit |
|-------|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Basic** | 99.9% | 43.8 minutes/month | 10% |
| **Professional** | 99.95% | 21.9 minutes/month | 15% |
| **Enterprise** | 99.99% | 4.38 minutes/month | 25% |

*Notes:*
- Availability is measured as the percentage of successful requests (non-5xx responses)
- Scheduled maintenance windows are excluded from this calculation
- Service credits apply to the following month's subscription fee

### Content Generation SLA

| Level | Success Rate | Service Credit |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Basic** | 95% | 10% |
| **Professional** | 97% | 15% |
| **Enterprise** | 99% | 25% |

*Notes:*
- Success is defined as content generation requests that complete without error
- Service credits apply to the following month's subscription fee

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Alert Thresholds

- **Burn Rate Alerts**: Trigger when error budget consumption rate indicates SLO will be breached
  - Fast burn: 2% of error budget consumed in 1 hour
  - Medium burn: 5% of error budget consumed in 6 hours
  - Slow burn: 10% of error budget consumed in 24 hours

### Response Times

| Severity | Initial Response | Resolution Target | Update Frequency |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **P1 (Critical)** | 15 minutes | 4 hours | Every 30 minutes |
| **P2 (High)** | 30 minutes | 8 hours | Every 2 hours |
| **P3 (Medium)** | 2 hours | 24 hours | Every 4 hours |
| **P4 (Low)** | 8 hours | 72 hours | Daily |

## SLO Reporting

- SLO performance is reported in the monthly service review
- SLO dashboards are available to all team members in Grafana
- Weekly SLO review meetings are conducted to address trends and concerns
- Quarterly reviews to assess and potentially revise SLO targets

## Error Budget Policy

When error budgets are depleted:

1. Further feature development is paused in favor of reliability improvements
2. Post-mortem analyses are required for all incidents that consume >10% of error budget
3. Teams must propose and implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence
4. Error budget consumption rate is factored into team performance evaluations

## Annual Review

These SLOs and SLAs will be reviewed annually to ensure they align with business objectives and customer expectations.
