## Environment Variables & Configuration

### Best Practices
- **NEVER** hardcode credentials, API keys, or secrets in source code
- Use environment variables for all sensitive information
- Set up different environment configurations for development, testing, and production
- Validate all environment variables on application startup
- Use sensible defaults only for non-sensitive settings

### Implementation in UMT
- All sensitive configuration values are loaded from environment variables in `src/core/settings.py`
- Default values are provided only for non-sensitive settings or for development environments
- Configuration validation is performed at startup to catch missing critical settings
- `.env.example` file provided as a template (never commit actual `.env` files)

## Secrets Management

### Best Practices
- Use a dedicated secrets management solution (Bitwarden Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- Implement secret rotation policies
- Limit access to secrets based on need-to-know principle
- Never log or expose secrets in error messages

### Implementation in UMT
- Bitwarden Vault integration through `src/core/secrets_manager.py`
- JWT secrets are rotated automatically and stored securely in the database
- Secrets are fetched on-demand from both Bitwarden and environment variables as fallback
- Automatic secret rotation for critical security tokens

## Authentication & Authorization

### Best Practices
- Use strong password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
- Implement MFA for sensitive operations
- Use RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for authorization
- Implement proper session management
- Use secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies

### Implementation in UMT
- BCrypt password hashing with proper work factor
- TOTP-based MFA and backup codes
- RBAC with granular permissions
- Short-lived JWT tokens with proper validation
- Strict cookie security settings

## Input Validation

### Best Practices
- Validate all input on both client and server side
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement strict type checking
- Apply security-focused validation rules
- Sanitize output to prevent XSS attacks

### Implementation in UMT
- Pydantic models for API request/response validation
- SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries
- Type annotations throughout the codebase
- Input validation with specific error messages

## Database Security

### Best Practices
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Apply principle of least privilege for database users
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement database connection pooling with proper limits
- Regular database backups and security audits

### Implementation in UMT
- SQLAlchemy ORM automatically protects against SQL injection
- Separate schema (`umt`) for isolation
- Field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Database connection pooling with timeout and overflow protection
- Migrations are versioned and tested before deployment

## Frontend Security

### Best Practices
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Use CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- Apply proper input validation and sanitization
- Avoid exposing sensitive data in client-side code
- Use HTTPS for all communications

### Implementation in UMT
- CSP headers configured for specific content sources
- CSRF protection with double-submit cookie pattern
- React security best practices in frontend code
- State-changing operations require CSRF token validation
- Secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, SameSite, Secure)

## API Security

### Best Practices
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Apply proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all input and sanitize output
- Return appropriate status codes and error messages

### Implementation in UMT
- Rate limiting middleware
- JWT-based authentication with validation
- Role-based API endpoint protection
- Consistent error handling with security in mind
- API versioning to maintain backward compatibility

## JWT Security

### Best Practices
- Use strong, randomly generated secrets
- Implement proper secret rotation
- Include appropriate claims (exp, nbf, iat, etc.)
- Keep tokens short-lived
- Implement proper token validation
- Protect against token theft

### Implementation in UMT
- JWT secret rotation with database-backed storage
- Short-lived tokens (24 hours by default)
- Multiple security claims in tokens (exp, iat, kid)
- Token validation with proper error handling
- Device tracking for suspicious login detection

## Infrastructure Security

### Best Practices
- Use the principle of least privilege
- Implement proper network segmentation
- Enable security monitoring and logging
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Regular security scanning and penetration testing

### Implementation in UMT
- Docker containerization with security best practices
- Database connections limited to application containers
- Resource constraints for containers
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning

## Monitoring & Incident Response

### Best Practices
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Set up alerts for security events
- Have an incident response plan
- Regular security exercises
- Post-incident reviews

### Implementation in UMT
- Structured logging with security events
- Security alerts for suspicious activities
- Rate limiting and IP blocking for abuse prevention
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Code Review Security Checklist

When reviewing code, ensure these security aspects are covered:

1. ✅ No hardcoded credentials or secrets
2. ✅ Proper input validation on all user-controllable data
3. ✅ No SQL injection vulnerabilities
4. ✅ Appropriate authentication and authorization checks
5. ✅ Secure handling of sensitive data
6. ✅ No security-critical information in logs
7. ✅ CSRF protection for state-changing operations
8. ✅ Proper error handling without information leakage
9. ✅ No unnecessary permissions or access
10. ✅ Dependencies are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities

## Secure Development Workflow

1. **Security Requirements**: Include security requirements in all feature planning
2. **Threat Modeling**: Identify security threats early in development
3. **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding guidelines
4. **Security Testing**: Include security tests in CI/CD pipeline
5. **Code Review**: Use the security checklist for all code reviews
6. **Security Scanning**: Run automated security scans regularly
7. **Dependency Checking**: Monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities
8. **Security Training**: Regular security training for all developers
