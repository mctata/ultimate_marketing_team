## Overview

The Ultimate Marketing Team platform includes comprehensive compliance features to help organizations meet global data protection and privacy regulations. These features are designed to be flexible and adaptable to evolving compliance requirements while minimizing impact on system performance and user experience.

## Data Retention

}
```

}
```

### Data Classification

## Getting Started

### Creating a Data Retention Policy

To create a data retention policy:

```bash
# Using the API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/compliance/retention/policies \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "entity_type": "content",
    "retention_period_days": 365,
    "archive_strategy": "archive",
    "legal_basis": "Business necessity",
    "applies_to_deleted": true
  }'
```

### Handling a Data Subject Access Request

To process a data subject access request:

1. Create the request record in the system
2. Generate the data export:

```bash
python scripts/export_user_data.py --request-id 123 --format json
```

3. Review the export for sensitive information
4. Provide the export to the data subject
5. Update the request status to completed

### Running Data Retention Tasks

To execute data retention policies:

```bash
# Execute all retention policies
python scripts/run_data_retention.py

# Execute retention for a specific entity type
python scripts/run_data_retention.py --entity-type user
```

For automated execution, add to crontab:

```
# Run data retention every day at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /usr/bin/python /path/to/ultimate_marketing_team/scripts/run_data_retention.py >> /path/to/logs/retention.log 2>&1
```
