# PostgreSQL 17 Migration & Staging Deployment Improvements

## Summary

- Updated all Docker configurations to use PostgreSQL 17-alpine
- Fixed SQL syntax for database creation in PostgreSQL 17
- Enhanced pgvector extension installation for PostgreSQL 17 compatibility
- Added robust database initialization sequence with proper health checks
- Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide for PostgreSQL 17 deployment
- Added staging environment configuration and deployment script improvements

## Key Changes

### 1. PostgreSQL 17 Configuration Updates
- Updated all docker-compose files to use PostgreSQL 17-alpine
- Fixed SQL command syntax for database creation in PostgreSQL 17
- Updated CI/CD pipelines to use PostgreSQL 17 for testing

### 2. pgvector Installation Improvements
- Added JIT compilation fallback for pgvector in PostgreSQL 17
- Enhanced verification script for pgvector functionality
- Updated build process for Alpine Linux compatibility

### 3. Deployment Process Improvements
- Created a sequence-aware deployment process that:
  1. Starts PostgreSQL first
  2. Verifies database is healthy
  3. Initializes schema through a proxy service
  4. Runs migrations with proper dependency checking
  5. Starts remaining services only after database is ready
  6. Verifies health of all services
  7. Automatically runs repair script if needed

### 4. Error Recovery & Diagnostics
- Added comprehensive database repair script (`fix_api_gateway_db.sh`)
- Added automatic detection of PostgreSQL version
- Enhanced health check endpoints for all services
- Added detailed troubleshooting documentation

### 5. Documentation
- Updated README with PostgreSQL 17 information
- Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- Added step-by-step instructions for common issues

## Testing
All changes have been tested in a local environment to ensure:
- PostgreSQL 17 starts properly
- pgvector extension installs correctly
- Database initialization sequence works as expected
- API gateway connects to the database
- Health checks function properly

## Staging Deployment Instructions
1. Ensure Docker is running
2. Make the deployment scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/deployment/staging/deploy.sh
   chmod +x scripts/deployment/fix_api_gateway_db.sh
   ```
3. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deployment/staging/deploy.sh
   ```
4. If any issues occur, check the logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml logs api-gateway
   ```
5. For database-specific issues, run the repair script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deployment/fix_api_gateway_db.sh
   ```
