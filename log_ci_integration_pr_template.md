# Implement CI/CD Log Integration

This PR integrates our new logging system with the CI/CD pipeline. It adds steps to collect and archive log files from test jobs, making it easier to diagnose issues in CI/CD runs.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Log Collection and Archiving**:
   - Added steps to collect logs from Python tests
   - Added steps to collect logs from migration verification
   - Added steps to collect logs from migration tests
   - Configured logging artifact retention policies

2. **Added CI/CD Initialization**:
   - Created a new job to initialize the logs directory at the start of each workflow
   - Updated job dependencies to include this initialization step

3. **Added Documentation**:
   - Created CI_CD_LOG_INTEGRATION.md with details about the implementation
   - Updated LOGGING_IMPROVEMENTS.md to reflect completed tasks

## Benefits

- **Simplified Debugging**: Log files are now available as GitHub artifacts, making it easier to diagnose issues without rerunning workflows
- **Historical Log Access**: Logs are retained for 7 days, allowing for historical analysis
- **Improved Collaboration**: Team members can access logs without direct server access
- **Reduced Manual Steps**: No need to add print statements or debug code to diagnose CI issues

## Implementation Details

Log files are collected at the end of each job:

1. Python test logs → `python-test-logs` artifact
2. Migration verification logs → `migration-verification-logs` artifact
3. Migration test logs → `migration-test-logs` artifact

Each artifact includes:
- All log files from the job (*.log*)
- A README.md file with metadata
- List of collected log files

## How to Use

To access logs from a workflow run:

1. Go to the GitHub Actions tab for the repository
2. Select the specific workflow run
3. Scroll down to the "Artifacts" section
4. Download the desired log archive (e.g., "python-test-logs")
5. Extract the archive to view the log files

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements include:

1. Automated log analysis to detect common error patterns
2. Integration with external log aggregation services
3. Real-time log streaming for long-running jobs
4. Selective log collection based on test results
