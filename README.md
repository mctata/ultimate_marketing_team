## AI Agent Team Structure
Our Ultimate Marketing Team consists of five specialized agents working together through a shared message bus and knowledge repository:

1. **Auth & Integration Agent**: Manages secure user authentication via social accounts and configures platform integrations with CMS, social media, and ad campaign platforms. Regularly verifies API connectors to ensure compliance with evolving ad and CMS APIs.

2. **Brand & Project Management Agent**: Onboards brands by capturing company information and brand guidelines, and sets up multiple project types per brand, automatically enriching data from website URLs. Implements role-based access control (RBAC) and audit trails for enhanced security as brands and projects scale.

3. **Content Strategy & Competitor Research Agent**: Analyzes content topics, performance metrics, and competitor data to develop competitive, data-driven content calendars. Leverages competitor insights to ensure your platform not only follows marketing trends but also innovates ahead of the curve.

4. **Content Creation & Testing Agent**: Uses AI language models to generate multiple content drafts that align with brand guidelines and conducts A/B testing to select top-performing variations for each project type. Iterative testing helps refine content quality over time, closely integrating audience feedback for improved conversion rates.

5. **Content & Ad Management Agent**: Handles the end-to-end process of organizing, scheduling, and publishing content across channels while managing ad campaigns through Google Ads and Facebook Ads integrations. Runs predictive analytics to forecast engagement trends and ad campaign ROI, making data-backed adjustments in real-time.
