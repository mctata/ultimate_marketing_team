# Centralized Logging System Implementation

## Summary
This PR implements a centralized logging system throughout the codebase, standardizing logging practices across all scripts and components. The main improvements include:

1. Standardized logging format and patterns across all scripts
2. Enhanced security through credential masking in logs
3. Improved error handling with detailed logging
4. Centralized log configuration and management
5. Better structure for log file organization and naming
6. Detailed operation logging for database operations and API requests

## Changes Made
The implementation includes:

1. Creation of a centralized logging utility (`scripts/utilities/logging_utils.py`)
2. Update of 9 scripts to use the centralized logging utility:
   - `scripts/database/direct_db_users.py`
   - `scripts/database/pre_migration_check.py`
   - `scripts/notifications/notify_migration_status.py`
   - `scripts/monitoring/monitor_search_console_api.py`
   - `scripts/seeding/seed_database.py`
   - `scripts/testing/create_test_user.py`
   - `scripts/testing/create_test_users.py`
   - `scripts/notifications/notify_deploy_status.py`
   - `scripts/notifications/notify_test_status.py`
3. Implementation of specialized logging functions:
   - `setup_logger`: Creates and configures a logger instance with appropriate handlers
   - `log_command_execution`: Standardized logging for commands, API calls, and shell operations
   - `log_database_operation`: Standardized logging for database operations (INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, etc.)

## Key Improvements

### Security
- Credentials and sensitive tokens are now masked in logs
- Database connection strings have password components redacted
- Authentication tokens are truncated to prevent exposure

### Error Handling
- Standardized try/except blocks with detailed error logging
- Consistent error handling patterns for external service integration
- Failure scenarios now include comprehensive diagnostic information

### Maintainability
- Consistent logging patterns make logs easier to parse and understand
- Standard log format allows for easier log aggregation and analysis
- Detailed context in logs makes troubleshooting more efficient

## Testing
All updated scripts have been manually tested to ensure:
1. Proper logging of operations
2. Correct masking of sensitive information
3. Appropriate error handling
4. Compatibility with existing functionality

## Future Work
Future improvements to the logging system include:
1. Implementing log rotation to manage log file size
2. Creating utilities for cleaning up old log files
3. Developing a log viewing utility for easier analysis
4. Integrating with external log aggregation services
5. Adding unit tests for the logging utilities

## Breaking Changes
None. The logging implementation is backwards compatible and doesn't change any functionality.

## Screenshots
N/A - This is a backend infrastructure change with no UI components.
