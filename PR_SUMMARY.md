# Pull Request: Docker Configuration Improvements for Staging Environment

## Summary

This PR addresses critical deployment issues with the Ultimate Marketing Team application on staging servers. It enhances PostgreSQL with pgvector support, fixes Docker configuration issues, improves frontend deployment, and adds a lightweight health API. The changes ensure a more reliable and consistent deployment process with appropriate error handling and better validation.

## Changes

1. **PostgreSQL Enhancements**
   - Created a custom Dockerfile for PostgreSQL with pgvector pre-installed
   - Implemented fallback for JIT disabling when needed
   - Added verification scripts for extension installation
   - Created SQL scripts for proper schema initialization
   - Added container health check to verify extension functionality

2. **Docker Compose Configuration**
   - Fixed path references with proper relative notation
   - Updated environment variables configuration
   - Enhanced database configuration with proper volume mounts
   - Added health checks for service reliability
   - Added a lightweight health-api service with simple_health.py for reliable health monitoring
   - Implemented proper service dependency checks with condition: service_healthy

3. **Frontend Configuration**
   - Fixed Dockerfile path references for nginx.conf
   - Enhanced Nginx configuration for API proxying
   - Fixed potential path resolution issues in build context

4. **Application Fixes**
   - Added user.py compatibility layer to fix import issues
   - Fixed Python module structure issues
   - Fixed Docker build context paths

5. **Repository Organization**
   - Removed unused configuration files (docker-compose.ec2.yml)
   - Cleaned up git branches
   - Created comprehensive documentation

## Testing

Staged deployment and verification have been tested on EC2. Key components:

1. **PostgreSQL with pgvector**
   - Verified PostgreSQL container starts successfully with pgvector installed
   - Tested vector operations to ensure extension functionality
   - Validated healthcheck is accurately detecting extension status

2. **Docker Compose Configuration**
   - Confirmed proper network creation and container communication
   - Verified volume persistence for database data
   - Tested environment variable propagation to containers

3. **Frontend Configuration**
   - Confirmed proper static file serving
   - Verified API proxying to backend services

4. **Health API Endpoint**
   - Dedicated health API endpoint available at http://staging.tangible-studios.com:8001/
   - Provides independent availability monitoring separate from main application 
   - Returns JSON with status, timestamp, service name, version, and environment
   - Implemented as a lightweight FastAPI service with minimal dependencies

5. **Deployment Process**
   - Test connection: `./scripts/deployment/test_connection.sh`
   - Deploy staging: `./scripts/deployment/staging/deploy_staging.sh`
   - Verify services: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml ps`

## Deployment Considerations

- The PostgreSQL container includes fallback mechanisms for pgvector installation
- The frontend's nginx configuration handles API proxying properly
- A dedicated health endpoint provides reliable monitoring
- Database volumes ensure data persistence across deployments
- Container health checks ensure services are properly functioning

## Future Work

- Resolve API gateway initialization issues related to database connectivity
- Add support for rollback to previous deployment version
- Implement automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Enhance error monitoring and alerting for production
- Add database migration verification steps
- Add more comprehensive health checks for all services
