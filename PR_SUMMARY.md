# Pull Request: Security Improvements for Deployment Configuration

## Summary

This PR addresses critical security concerns by removing hardcoded credentials and implementing a secure deployment configuration system using Bitwarden as a credential vault. It adds templates instead of actual configuration files and creates a secure workflow for fetching credentials during deployment.

## Changes

1. **Removed Sensitive Files**
   - Removed all deployment configuration files with real credentials
   - Removed `.env.staging` file containing database passwords and API keys
   - Replaced them with template files containing placeholders

2. **Enhanced Security Measures**
   - Added `.gitignore` rules to prevent committing sensitive files
   - Created template files with placeholder values
   - Implemented Bitwarden integration for secure credential storage

3. **New Secure Deployment Workflow**
   - Added `fetch_secrets.sh` script to securely retrieve credentials from Bitwarden
   - Updated deployment script to automatically fetch credentials when needed
   - Added support for both deployment configuration and application environment variables

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Created comprehensive `DEPLOYMENT_SECURITY.md` guide
   - Updated main deployment guide to reference the new security measures
   - Added README for the config/env directory with security guidelines

## Testing

The following tests should be performed:

1. Verify Bitwarden integration works:
   ```
   ./scripts/utilities/fetch_secrets.sh staging
   ```

2. Verify deployment using fetched credentials:
   ```
   ./scripts/deployment/deploy.sh staging
   ```

3. Verify files don't get committed:
   ```
   git add .
   git status  # Should not show the actual credential files
   ```

## Security Considerations

- Credentials are now stored in Bitwarden's secure vault
- Only template files with placeholders are committed to Git
- Multiple levels of security checks in the deployment process
- Clear documentation for the security workflow

## Future Work

- Implement automated credential rotation
- Add support for production environment secrets
- Add validation checks for credential strength
- Consider integrating with AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for production
