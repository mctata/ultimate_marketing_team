# PR Summary: Deployment Improvements

## Summary
This PR enhances the deployment process through three major improvements:
1. Standard PostgreSQL configuration with vector extension support across all environments
2. Consolidated deployment directory structure for better organization
3. Improved deployment scripts with environment-specific organization

## Changes
This PR introduces:

1. **PostgreSQL 17 Configuration**
   - Using `postgres:17-alpine` image across all environments to match AWS RDS
   - Added vector extension support through initialization scripts
   - Created verification scripts to ensure proper extension installation
   - Updated all Docker Compose files to use consistent configuration

2. **Deployment Directory Consolidation**
   - Created a unified directory structure under `deployments/`
   - Added subdirectories for different environments (staging, production)
   - Created README files for all directories with naming conventions
   - Updated script references to use the new directory structure

3. **Deployment Script Organization**
   - Created environment-specific deployment scripts in `scripts/deployment/staging/`
   - Added a versatile `quick_deploy.sh` script for deploying existing archives
   - Added a staging-specific `quick_deploy.sh` script with simplified interface
   - Added a verification script to check deployment setup
   - Updated all documentation to reflect the new script organization

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Created DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md with comprehensive deployment instructions
   - Created POSTGRES_CONFIG.md with PostgreSQL 17 configuration details
   - Updated SCRIPTS.md with new script references
   - Updated scripts/README.md with detailed script descriptions

## Testing
- Tested PostgreSQL configuration in development environment
- Verified vector extension functionality with test queries
- Ran the deployment setup verification script
- Validated all script paths in the documentation
- Tested archive creation and storage

## Future Work
- Create similar scripts for production environment
- Update CI/CD configuration to use the new deployment structure
- Implement automatic cleanup of old deployment archives
- Add automated archive testing before deployment
