# Pull Request: Deployment Improvements and Schema/Frontend Fixes

## Summary

This PR addresses critical deployment issues with the Ultimate Marketing Team application on staging servers. It fixes schema import errors and frontend build problems by enhancing the deployment process with verification steps and proper file handling. The updates ensure a reliable deployment process with comprehensive error checks and better documentation.

## Changes

1. **Fixed Schema Import Issues**
   - Updated API Gateway Dockerfile to properly include the schema directory
   - Added verification script to check schema files exist before deployment
   - Fixed import path issues for template schemas

2. **Fixed Frontend Build Process**
   - Updated Frontend Dockerfile to correctly reference frontend/dist directory
   - Added frontend build step to the compact_deploy.sh script
   - Added verification script to ensure frontend is properly built

3. **Enhanced Deployment Process**
   - Fixed permission issues when removing existing deployment directory
   - Added sudo fallback for file permission problems
   - Improved Docker container handling and error recovery
   - Added comprehensive verification steps for deployment

4. **New Verification Scripts**
   - Added `verify_frontend.sh` to validate frontend build files
   - Added `verify_schemas.sh` to check API schema imports
   - Added `verify_migrations.sh` to confirm database setup
   - Enhanced `verify_deployment.sh` for more thorough checks

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated main deployment guide with new verification steps
   - Added detailed troubleshooting sections for common issues
   - Added comprehensive staging deployment README
   - Added step-by-step deployment instructions

## Testing

The following tests should be performed:

1. Test the deployment connection:
   ```
   ./scripts/deployment/test_connection.sh
   ```

2. Verify frontend build process:
   ```
   ./scripts/deployment/verify_frontend.sh
   ```

3. Verify schema files exist:
   ```
   ./scripts/deployment/verify_schemas.sh
   ```

4. Deploy using the compact deployment script:
   ```
   ./scripts/deployment/staging/compact_deploy.sh
   ```

5. Verify deployment was successful:
   ```
   ./scripts/deployment/verify_deployment.sh
   ./scripts/deployment/verify_migrations.sh
   ```

## Deployment Considerations

- The compact_deploy.sh script includes automated verification steps
- Frontend assets are now properly built and deployed
- API schema dependencies are correctly included
- Error handling has been improved for permission issues
- Detailed troubleshooting steps are provided for common issues

## Future Work

- Implement automated verification of deployment health metrics
- Add support for rollback to previous deployment version
- Enhance frontend build with production optimizations
- Add database schema version compatibility checks
- Improve logging during deployment process
- Implement automated notification system for deployment status
