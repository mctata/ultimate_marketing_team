# Archived Deployment Scripts

These scripts are deprecated and have been replaced by the unified \`deploy_staging.sh\` script.
They are kept here for reference only and should not be used for deployment.

## Replacement

Instead of these scripts, use:

\`\`\`bash
# Deploy to staging
./scripts/deployment/deploy_staging.sh

# Test deployment without actually deploying
./scripts/deployment/deploy_staging.sh --dry-run
\`\`\`

## Archive Date

These scripts were archived on $(date '+%Y-%m-%d').

# Move scripts to archive directory

  if [ -f "$script" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$ARCHIVE_DIR/$(dirname "$script")"
