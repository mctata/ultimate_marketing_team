# Ultimate Marketing Team Architecture Documentation

## 1. System Overview

The Ultimate Marketing Team platform is a comprehensive marketing automation system built around five specialized AI agents that work together to optimize marketing campaigns. The system follows a domain-driven design approach with clear bounded contexts and uses messaging-based communication to coordinate actions between components.

### 1.1 Core Components

The platform consists of the following core components:

1. **Base Agent Framework**
   - Protocol-based interfaces for dependency injection
   - Message broker abstraction for communication
   - Circuit breaker pattern for failure isolation
   - Distributed tracing for observability

2. **Specialized AI Agents**
   - Auth & Integration Agent: Handles authentication and platform integrations
   - Brand & Project Management Agent: Manages brand onboarding and project setup
   - Content Strategy & Research Agent: Analyzes content performance and competitors
   - Content Creation & Testing Agent: Generates and tests content variations
   - Content & Ad Management Agent: Handles publishing and ad campaign management

3. **Domain Model**
   - Brand bounded context: Manages brand identity and styling
   - Content bounded context: Handles content creation, versioning, and metadata
   - Campaign bounded context: Manages ad campaigns, ad sets, and targeting
   - Analytics bounded context: Tracks performance metrics and reporting
   - Integration bounded context: Connects with external services

4. **Infrastructure Services**
   - Message broker (RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication
   - Cache layer (Redis) for performance optimization
   - Database layer (PostgreSQL) for persistent storage
   - Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) for observability
   - Circuit breakers for resilience

### 1.2 Key Design Principles

The architecture is based on the following principles:

1. **Interface-Based Design**: Agents and services implement defined interfaces, enabling loose coupling and easier testing.
2. **Message-Based Communication**: Components communicate via standardized messages, making the system more resilient and easier to extend.
3. **Domain-Driven Design**: The system is organized around the business domain, with clear bounded contexts and aggregate roots.
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of protection including circuit breakers, retries, and graceful degradation enhance system resilience.
5. **Observability First**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and distributed tracing enable effective monitoring and troubleshooting.

## 3. Domain Model

### 3.1 Bounded Contexts

The system is divided into the following bounded contexts:

#### 3.1.1 Brand Context

Responsible for managing brand information, styling, and industry data.

**Aggregates**:
- Brand (root)

**Value Objects**:
- Industry
- BrandColor
- StylingProperties

**Events**:
- BrandCreatedEvent
- BrandUpdatedEvent

#### 3.1.2 Content Context

Handles the creation, versioning, and management of marketing content.

**Aggregates**:
- Content (root)
- Template

**Entities**:
- ContentVersion

**Value Objects**:
- ContentMetadata
- ContentStatus
- ContentType

**Events**:
- ContentCreatedEvent
- ContentStatusChangedEvent
- VersionAddedEvent

#### 3.1.3 Campaign Context

Manages advertising campaigns and ad delivery.

**Aggregates**:
- Campaign (root)

**Entities**:
- AdSet

**Value Objects**:
- Budget
- TargetingCriteria
- CampaignStatus

**Events**:
- CampaignCreatedEvent
- CampaignStatusChangedEvent
- AdSetAddedEvent

#### 3.1.4 Analytics Context

Tracks and analyzes performance metrics for content and campaigns.

**Aggregates**:
- Report (root)
- MetricCollection

**Value Objects**:
- Metric
- TimeFrame
- Dimension
- Insight

**Events**:
- ReportGeneratedEvent
- InsightDiscoveredEvent

#### 3.1.5 Integration Context

Connects with external services and platforms.

**Aggregates**:
- Integration (root)
- Credentials

**Value Objects**:
- ConnectionSettings
- SyncStatus
- AuthConfiguration

**Events**:
- IntegrationConnectedEvent
- SyncCompletedEvent

### 3.2 Context Mapping

The bounded contexts interact with each other through well-defined interfaces:

1. **Brand → Content**: Content references brands for styling and identity
2. **Content → Campaign**: Campaigns use content in their ad sets
3. **Campaign → Analytics**: Analytics tracks campaign performance
4. **Content → Analytics**: Analytics tracks content performance
5. **Integration → All**: Integrations publish data to other contexts

## 4. Communication Patterns

The system uses the following communication patterns:

### 4.1 Message Types

1. **TaskMessage**: Request for a specific agent to perform a task
2. **EventMessage**: Notification about a significant event
3. **ResponseMessage**: Response to a task request
4. **ErrorMessage**: Error information for failed tasks
5. **HeartbeatMessage**: Health check to monitor agent availability
6. **SystemMessage**: System-wide notifications

### 4.2 Communication Flows

1. **Command Flow**: Direct task assignment with synchronous response
   ```
   Agent A → TaskMessage → Agent B → ResponseMessage → Agent A
   ```

2. **Event Flow**: Broadcasting events to interested agents
   ```
   Agent A → EventMessage → [All subscribed agents]
   ```

3. **Query Flow**: Requesting data from other agents
   ```
   Agent A → TaskMessage (query) → Agent B → ResponseMessage (data) → Agent A
   ```

## 5. Error Handling & Resilience

The system implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

### 5.1 Circuit Breaker Pattern

To prevent cascading failures, the platform uses the circuit breaker pattern with three states:

1. **Closed**: Normal operation, calls pass through
2. **Open**: When failure threshold is exceeded, calls fail fast
3. **Half-Open**: After recovery timeout, allows limited calls to test recovery

### 5.2 Retry Mechanism

For transient failures, the system implements an exponential backoff retry mechanism:

- Base retry interval increases exponentially with each attempt
- Random jitter prevents synchronized retries
- Maximum retry limit and timeout prevents infinite retries

### 5.3 Failure Isolation

Each agent operates independently, preventing failures in one agent from affecting others:

- Message-based communication allows agents to function independently
- Circuit breakers prevent repeated calls to failing services
- Graceful degradation when dependencies are unavailable

## 6. Observability

The platform includes comprehensive observability features:

### 6.1 Distributed Tracing

Using OpenTelemetry, the system provides:

- End-to-end request tracking across service boundaries
- Span hierarchy showing nested operations
- Context propagation through messages and API calls
- Performance metrics for operation duration
- Exception tracking with detailed error information

### 6.2 Logging

Structured logging includes:

- Contextual information with each log entry
- Correlation IDs linking related operations
- Log levels for filtering and prioritization
- Agent-specific logs for targeted troubleshooting

### 6.3 Metrics

Key metrics tracked by the system:

- Message throughput and latency
- Task success/failure rates
- Circuit breaker state changes
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, etc.)
- Business KPIs (content performance, campaign ROI, etc.)

## 7. Security

### 7.1 Authentication & Authorization

- OAuth2 with JWT for API authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization
- Separate authentication for external service integrations
- Credential encryption and secure storage

### 7.2 Data Protection

- Encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Data access logging for compliance and auditing
- Privacy controls for user data
